# Smooth plane curves

This file sets up the minimal foundation for Silverman chapter II
(`.mathlib-quality/tickets/` stream A). It provides `SmoothPlaneCurve F` as a
thin wrapper over mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.Affine F`, together with
associated notions of smooth points, coordinate ring, and function field.

A future refactor (tracked by `T-II-1-001`) will generalize
`SmoothPlaneCurve` to arbitrary irreducible polynomials in `F[X, Y]` and
prove that the local ring at a smooth point is a discrete valuation ring.
For now, the Weierstrass case is enough to state and develop divisors,
differentials, and the other chapter-II concepts that the Hasse–Weil proof
needs downstream.
