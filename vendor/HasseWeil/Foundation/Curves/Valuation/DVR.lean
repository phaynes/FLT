# The local ring at a smooth point of a plane curve is a DVR

This file closes ticket `T-II-1-001` (Silverman II.1.1): for a smooth plane
curve `C` and a smooth point `P ∈ C`, the localization of the coordinate ring
at the maximal ideal of `P` is a discrete valuation ring.

The substantive proof lives in `HasseWeil.Valuation` — it is a general
statement about affine Weierstrass curves over a field (no `IsElliptic`
hypothesis is required, contrary to earlier belief). This file simply
repackages it for the `SmoothPlaneCurve` abstraction of Stream A.
