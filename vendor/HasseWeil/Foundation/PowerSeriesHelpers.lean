# Auxiliary lemmas for `PowerSeries`

This file collects power-series lemmas that are used across the Hasse–Weil
development but are not yet available in mathlib. Each lemma is stated at
maximum generality (the weakest typeclass the proof needs).

## Main result

* `PowerSeries.eq_zero_of_self_eq_mul_self` — if `f = g * f` in `R⟦X⟧` and
  `g` has zero constant coefficient, then `f = 0`. This is a self-multiplication
  cancellation lemma derived from the order valuation: `order (g * f) ≥
  order g + order f ≥ 1 + order f`, forcing `order f = ⊤` and hence `f = 0`.

Used by formal-group uniqueness arguments, e.g. `formalW_unique`
(Silverman IV.1.1(b)), where the hypothesis `f = g · f` arises by factoring
a difference of Weierstrass recurrences.

/-- **Self-multiplication cancellation**: if `f = g * f` in `R⟦X⟧` and the
constant coefficient of `g` is zero, then `f = 0`.

Derived from the order valuation: `1 ≤ order g` combined with
`order g + order f ≤ order (g * f) = order f` forces `order f = ⊤`. -/

/-- Commutative variant: if `f = f * g` and `constantCoeff g = 0`, then `f = 0`.
Follows from `eq_zero_of_self_eq_mul_self` by commuting the multiplication. -/
