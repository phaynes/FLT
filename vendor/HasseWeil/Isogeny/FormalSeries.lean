# Formal isogeny series and the bridge to `omegaPullbackCoeff`

For an isogeny `α : E → E` over a field `F`, its **formal isogeny series**
`formalIsogenySeries W α : PowerSeries F` records the expansion of
`α.pullback t ∈ K(E)` in the local parameter `t = −x/y` at the identity `O`.

## Main definitions

* `formalIsogenySeries W α` — the power series whose `n`-th coefficient is
  the coefficient of `t^n` in the Laurent expansion `localExpand (α.pullback (localParam W))`.
  For a "genuine" isogeny (one sending `O` to `O`), this Laurent series has
  non-negative order, so the `PowerSeries` representation is faithful.

## Main theorems (BRIDGE chain)

* `T-IV-BRIDGE-001` / `omegaPullbackCoeff_eq_formalIsogenyLeading` —
  `omegaPullbackCoeff W α = coeff 1 (formalIsogenySeries W α)` (Silverman
  IV.4.3, "a_φ = φ′(0)"), under the genuineness hypothesis
  `0 < orderTop (localExpand (α.pullback t))` (the t-adic form of `α(O) = O`).

* `T-IV-BRIDGE-003` / `formalIsogenySeries_add` — Silverman IV.1.4: the local
  expansion of the `z = −x/y` coordinate of the genuine pair sum
  `α(P) + β(P)` (the chord-tangent `addPullback_x_pair`/`addPullback_y_pair`)
  equals the formal group law applied to
  `(formalIsogenySeries α, formalIsogenySeries β)`, for summands that reduce
  to `O` and are not mutual inverses. Its conclusion is verbatim the `h_iv14`
  hypothesis of `addPullback_x_pair_sum_reduces_of_iv14_witness`
  (`Verschiebung/Genuine.lean`), so it discharges that Wall-A witness by
  `exact`. **PROVEN** — the statement and proof live in
  `HasseWeil.ChordExpansion` (FG-B5; the proof needs the
  `FormalGroupLawSpec`/`ChordExpansion` chord apparatus, which imports this
  file).

BRIDGE-001 remains `sorry` at the substantive mathematical step. Both
bridges were **restated 2026-06-11** into guarded true forms: the original
unguarded statements were refutable because the project's `Isogeny.pullback`
is an unconstrained `AlgHom`, decoupled from the point map (B2 log
`BRIDGE-003-B2` in `.mathlib-quality/b2_log.jsonl`; the individual
docstrings record the counterexamples).

/-- The **formal isogeny series** of `α : Isogeny E E`. This is the power
    series whose `n`-th coefficient is the coefficient of `t^n` in the
    Laurent-series expansion of `α.pullback (localParam W)` (which is
    `α` pulling back the local parameter `t = −x/y` at `O`).

    For a "genuine" isogeny (whose pullback is compatible with `O ↦ O`), the
    Laurent series has non-negative order, so coefficients at negative
    indices vanish and this `PowerSeries` representation is faithful.

/-! ### Constant coefficient / positive order (QF Layer-1 brick 4)

The local parameter `t = −x/y` vanishes at `O` (`ord_O(t) = 1`). A *genuine*
isogeny `α` satisfies `α(O) = O`, so `α.pullback t` also vanishes at `O`; hence
its `t`-adic expansion `localExpand (α.pullback t)` has order `≥ 1` and the
formal isogeny series has **zero constant term** (equivalently, positive
`PowerSeries.order`).

The `HasseWeil.Isogeny` structure (`Basic.lean`) carries only an unconstrained
algebra-hom `pullback` and an additive hom `toAddMonoidHom`, with **no field
forcing `pullback` to fix `O`** (and no compatibility between the two
components). So this brick is gated on the genuine-isogeny hypothesis, stated
here in the form already used for `[n]`/Frobenius in `SilvermanIV14.lean`:
`0 < orderTop (localExpand (α.pullback t))`. Every concrete isogeny in the
development supplies this (e.g.
`orderTop_localExpand_mulByInt_neg_one_pullback_localParam = 1`). -/

/-- **`constantCoeff (formalIsogenySeries W α) = 0` for a genuine isogeny**:
    if the local expansion of `α.pullback t` has positive `orderTop` (i.e.
    `α.pullback t` vanishes at `O`, which is the t-adic form of `α(O) = O`),
    then the formal isogeny series has zero constant term. -/

/-! ### Generic coefficient-1 substitution lemma

The following is a reformulation of `coeff_one_fAdd` (in
`FormalGroup/Definition.lean`) that does NOT require a `FormalGroup`
structure — it takes the three essential coefficient values as
hypotheses. This makes it applicable to `formalGroupLaw W` (via the
facts proved above) without needing to construct a full `FormalGroup F`
from the Weierstrass curve. -/

    with constant coefficient zero, the coefficient of `T^1` in
    `S(f(T), g(T))` equals `coeff 1 f + coeff 1 g`.

    This is the generic form of `coeff_one_fAdd`: the FormalGroup axioms
    there are used only to derive the three coefficient values, which are

/-! ### (a) The formal group law preserves positive order (the subgroup property)

This is the pure power-series content of Silverman VII.2.2 / IV.1: the formal
group law `F̂(u, v) = u + v + (higher cross terms)` has zero constant coefficient,
so substituting two power series `f, g` of *positive* order yields a power series
of positive order. Concretely `F̂(f, g)` has zero constant coefficient because
`F̂` has zero constant coefficient and `f, g` have zero constant coefficient
(every monomial `u^i v^j` with `i + j ≥ 1` then contributes `0` to the constant
term, and the `i = j = 0` term is excluded by `constantCoeff F̂ = 0`).

This is the "kernel of reduction at `O` is closed under addition" fact at the
formal-group level: positive order of `z` ⟺ the point reduces to `O`, and
`z(P₁ + P₂) = F̂(z(P₁), z(P₂))` preserves that. The statement is given generically
(taking only `constantCoeff S = 0` as the hypothesis on the bivariate series, so
it applies to `formalGroupLaw W` via `constantCoeff_formalGroupLaw`) and is
reusable for any pair of positive-order summand series. -/

/- **T-IV-BRIDGE-001** (Silverman IV.4.3, "a_φ = φ′(0)"): for a *genuine*
    isogeny, the linear coefficient of `formalIsogenySeries W α` equals the
    invariant-differential pullback coefficient `omegaPullbackCoeff W α`.

    Mathematical content: the expansion `α.pullback(t) = a_α · t + O(t²)`
    in `K(E)` has its linear coefficient equal to the coefficient by which
    `α*` scales the invariant differential `ω = dx/(2y + a₁x + a₃)` in the
    Kähler differential module. This is the bridge between the III.5
    invariant-differential definition and the IV.4 formal-series
    definition of `a_α`.

    **Why the `h_orderTop` genuineness hypothesis is REQUIRED** (restated
    2026-06-11; the unguarded form was refutable): the project `Isogeny`
    structure (`Basic.lean`) carries `pullback` as an *unconstrained*
    `AlgHom`, so translation pullbacks `τ_S^*` qualify as isogenies. For
    those, `ω` is translation-invariant (Silverman III.5.1), hence
    `omegaPullbackCoeff = 1`; but `localExpand (τ_S^* t)` is the expansion
    at `O` of `t ∘ τ_S`, whose linear coefficient is a derivative value at
    `S` (`≠ 1` generically — its constant term `t(S)` is even nonzero). The
    hypothesis is the brick-4 shape used throughout this file
    (`constantCoeff_formalIsogenySeries_of_orderTop_pos` above): the t-adic
    form of `α(O) = O`, which excludes the translation pathology.

    Per-α instances discharge the bridge directly, sorry-free:
    `omegaPullbackCoeff_eq_formalIsogenyLeading_id` (below),
    `omegaPullbackCoeff_eq_formalIsogenyLeading_negFrobeniusIsog` and the
    char-2 `bridge_001_γ_isogOneSub_negFrobenius_char_two`
    (`AdditionPullback/SilvermanIV14.lean`). Matching `orderTop` witnesses:
    `localExpand_localParam` (id),
    `orderTop_localExpand_mulByInt_neg_one_pullback_localParam`,
    `orderTop_localExpand_isogOneSub_negFrobenius_pullback_localParam`, and
    the generic pole bridge
    `orderTop_localExpand_pullback_localParam_pos_of_ord_x_neg` (below).

    **Discharge route** (kept open): prove the chain-rule leaf
    `pullback_invariantDiff_coeff_zero` (P, `GapQfKernel.lean`); then this
    statement follows via
    `omegaPullbackCoeff_eq_formalIsogenyLeading_via_localization` (ibid.,
    identical signature). -/
/-! #### Witness-parametric factorization of BRIDGE-001

The sorry above has TWO mathematical components, which we factor here so each
can be discharged independently:

1. **III.1.5 content** (`a_α ∈ F`): the omega pullback coefficient lies in the
   image of `algebraMap F KE`. Mathematically, this is "the invariant
   differential has no zeros or poles, so `α* ω / ω` is a global rational
   function with no zeros/poles, hence constant".

2. **IV.4.3 substance** (Kähler ↔ Laurent bridge): the constant value matches
   the linear coefficient of the formal series — the formal series literally
   records the local expansion.

The witness form below takes (1) as a hypothesis (a witness `c : F` with the
range identification) plus (2) the explicit identification with the formal
coefficient. Either chain — Silverman III.1.5 or formal-group correspondence
— produces both witnesses, then this lemma closes the sorry above by `rfl`. -/

/-- **Witness-parametric BRIDGE-001**: given that `omegaPullbackCoeff W α =
    algebraMap F KE c` for some `c : F` (Silverman III.1.5: invariant
    differential is a generator), and that `c` matches the linear formal
    coefficient (Silverman IV.4.3), the BRIDGE-001 identity holds. -/

/-! ### BRIDGE-001 general α scaffold (closer with III.5.5 + addition-pullback)

The general-α extension of BRIDGE-001 proceeds via two routes that compose:
* **Frobenius branch**: `omegaPullbackCoeff_frobenius = 0` (existing
  axiom-clean) combined with `formalIsogenySeries_frobenius = T^q` (existing
  axiom-clean) gives BRIDGE-001 for `α = π` directly via constant 0.
* **Identity branch**: `omegaPullbackCoeff_id = 1` and `formalIsogenySeries_id`
  give the constant 1 case.
* **Composite branch via III.5.2 additivity**: for `γ = m·id + n·π`, the
  omega-coefficient is `m·1 + n·0 = m` (linear combination), matching the
  formal series's linear coefficient via `formalIsogenySeries_add` (the formal
  group law's degree-1 expansion). -/

/-- **BRIDGE-001 closer for general α via III.5.5 + linearity (witness-parametric)**:
takes a constant-coefficient witness `c : F` for both sides and an additivity
witness for the formal series, then closes BRIDGE-001 by `rfl`-shape.

This composer is the ENTRY POINT for the general-α discharge: once `c` is
identified (either by direct computation for [n], frobenius, identity, or via
III.5.2 for combinations), the closure fires axiom-clean. -/

For `γ = α + β` with omega-coefficient `c_γ = c_α + c_β` (Silverman III.5.2)
and formal series `f_γ` with `coeff 1 f_γ = coeff 1 f_α + coeff 1 f_β` (the
formal group law's leading-term linearity), if BRIDGE-001 holds for `α` and `β`
with constants in `F`, then it holds for `γ` with the sum constant.

/-! ### T-IV-BRIDGE-003: proven in `HasseWeil.ChordExpansion`

The Silverman IV.1.4 chord-addition identity `formalIsogenySeries_add` — the
local `z = −x/y` expansion of the genuine pair sum `α(P) + β(P)` equals the
formal group law substituted at the two formal isogeny series — was stated
here as a `sorry` through 2026-06-11 and is now **proven** in
`HasseWeil.ChordExpansion` (which imports this file; the proof needs the
`FormalGroupLawSpec` chord apparatus, so the statement moved there).

**Statement-shape history.** The original BRIDGE-003 quantified over a third
isogeny `γ` with the *point-map* hypothesis `γ.toAddMonoidHom =
α.toAddMonoidHom + β.toAddMonoidHom` and concluded a `PowerSeries`-level
identity for `formalIsogenySeries W γ`. That is refutable: the project
`Isogeny` carries `pullback` and `toAddMonoidHom` as *independent* fields, so
the placeholder `γ := ⟨AlgHom.id, [2].toAddMonoidHom⟩` with `α = β = [1]`
satisfies the hypothesis while the two sides have different linear
coefficients (B2 log `BRIDGE-003-B2`, `.mathlib-quality/b2_log.jsonl`). The
proven form states the identity at the *pullback* level, where the sum is the
genuine group-law addition (`AdditionPullback.lean`), with no `γ` at all,
under the summand-reduces-to-`O` pole hypotheses and `AddNonInversePair`. -/

/-! #### Witness-parametric lemmas for the PowerSeries-level series identity

The lemmas in this section are stated for the *PowerSeries-level* identity
`formalIsogenySeries W γ = subst ![f_α, f_β] (formalGroupLaw W)` — the shape
of the pre-2026-06-11 BRIDGE-003.  As an unconditional statement from the
point-map hypothesis alone that shape is refutable (see the BRIDGE-003
docstring above), but as *hypothesis-driven* lemmas these remain true and
useful: a caller who has the identity for a specific genuine `γ` (e.g. for
`γ = [k+1]` with `(α, β) = ([k], [1])`, where `γ.pullback` IS the group-law
addition pullback) can break it into coefficient ladders here, and the
`n = 0` / `n = 1` rungs are discharged below from the formal-group-law
coefficient facts. The `[n]`-induction consumer is
`constantCoeff_formalIsogenySeries_mulByInt_via_bridge_003` at the end of
this file (which takes the `[k+1] = F([k], [1])` family as a hypothesis,
matching `formalIsogenySeries_FGL_additivity` in `GapQfKernel.lean`). -/

/-- **Witness-parametric BRIDGE-003**: given the pointwise series equality
    (for each `n : ℕ`) between `formalIsogenySeries W γ` and the formal-group
    substitution, the BRIDGE-003 conclusion holds.

    Useful when downstream callers can produce coefficient-by-coefficient
    identifications (e.g. via `coeff_one_subst_bivariate` for n = 1) without
    needing the full power-series equality. -/

/-- **Fresh-angle factorization of BRIDGE-003**: split the
    coefficient-ladder into n=0, n=1, n≥2 pieces.

    `n=0` (`h_zero`) is the constant-coefficient identity. For "genuine"
    isogenies (sending O to O), both sides have constant coefficient 0,
    so this reduces to `0 = 0`. The substantive content is the genuine-
    isogeny hypothesis itself (which BRIDGE-003 implicitly assumes).

    `n=1` (`h_one`) is the leading-linear-term identity. Both sides
    equal `coeff 1 fα + coeff 1 fβ`: the LHS via the formal-group-law's
    leading-term linearity (Silverman III.5.2), the RHS via
    `coeff_one_subst_bivariate` applied to `formalGroupLaw W` with
    `formalGroupLaw_coeff_single_zero_one` and `_single_one_one`.

    `n≥2` (`h_higher`) is the substantive arc — the formal group law's
    behavior at higher orders.

    This factorization isolates the substantive content (h_higher) from
    the foundational identities (h_zero, h_one), enabling downstream
    consumers to discharge the easy parts directly while leaving the
    hard part as a single named witness. -/

/-! ### Consequence: additivity of `omegaPullbackCoeff` via the bridge

The supported route is **witness-parametric and axiom-clean**:
`omegaPullbackCoeff_add_of_bridge_witnesses` (and its specialisation
`omegaPullbackCoeff_add_of_leading_witness`) takes the three BRIDGE-001
instances and the coefficient-1 additivity for the specific formal series
as hypotheses. No BRIDGE sorry is touched; per-α BRIDGE-001 instances (id,
negFrobeniusIsog, isogOneSub char-2 — see the BRIDGE-001 docstring) feed it
directly.

A former *unconditional* form (`omegaPullbackCoeff_add_via_bridge_of_constCoeff`)
was **deleted 2026-06-11**: it chained the two pre-restatement BRIDGE sorries
from the bare point-map hypothesis `γ.toAddMonoidHom = α.toAddMonoidHom +
β.toAddMonoidHom`, and was itself refutable for the same placeholder-`γ`
reason as the old BRIDGE-003 (B2 log `BRIDGE-003-B2`): with
`γ := ⟨AlgHom.id, [2].toAddMonoidHom⟩` and `α = β = [1]` its hypotheses hold
while the conclusion reads `1 = 1 + 1` in `K(E)` — false over every field.
After the BRIDGE-003 restatement (pullback-level, no `γ`) it was also no
longer derivable in that shape. It had zero consumers (re-verified by grep
2026-06-11). Pointwise III.5.2 additivity for *genuine* sums is shipped
independently (`omegaPullbackCoeff_addIsog_pair`, `RouteBInduction.lean`). -/

/-- **Witness-parametric T-III-5-002**: the omega pullback coefficient is
    additive given the three BRIDGE-001 instances and coefficient-1

    This form is **axiom-clean**: downstream workers who have produced
    the BRIDGE-001 instances and the specific coefficient-1 identity
    (e.g. via `coeff_one_fAdd` on a constructed `FormalGroup F`, or
    directly from `formalGroupLaw_coeff` at indices (1,0) and (0,1))

/-! ### Alternative path: `coeff 1 [n] = n` via BRIDGE-003 induction

`BridgeMulByInt.lean` ships `coeff_one_formalIsogenySeries_mulByInt`
(the BRIDGE-001 result for `[n]`) via the **Wronskian-derived** path,
which depends on `wronskian_Φ_ΨSq_nat` for `m ≥ 5`
(`OmegaPullbackCoeff.lean:477` sorry).

We give an **alternative witness-parametric path** via BRIDGE-003
(formal additivity) plus the `[1] = X` and `constantCoeff [n] = 0`
hypotheses. This proves `coeff 1 (formalIsogenySeries [n]) = n` by
induction on positive `n`, decomposing via `[n+1] = [n] + [1]` and
the bivariate substitution coefficient identity.

If BRIDGE-003 closes first (e.g. via formal-group infrastructure
for the addition-pullback), the Wronskian dependency is bypassed.

(addition formula → induction). -/

/-! ### QF Layer-1 brick 5: positive formal order of `α*t` ⟹ pole of `α*x`

This is the bridge from a *positive-order formal parameter pullback* to a
*pole of `x`* at the point at infinity `O`. Concretely: at `O` the local
parameter is `t = -x/y` with `ord_O(x) = -2`, `ord_O(t) = 1`, and
`x = t⁻² · u` for a unit `u` (with `ord_O(u) = 0`); this is the shipped
formal identity `localExpand_x_gen : localExpand W (x_gen W) = formalX W`
together with `formalX = single(-2,1) · u⁻¹` (`LocalExpansion.formalX`,
`formalX_orderTop = -2`).

For an isogeny `α`, if `α*t = α.pullback (localParam W)` vanishes at `O`
(`0 < orderTop (localExpand (α*t))` — the genuine-isogeny / `α(O) = O`
hypothesis, the same shape as brick 4's
`constantCoeff_formalIsogenySeries_of_orderTop_pos`), then `α*x` has a pole:
`ordAtInfty (α*x) < 0`.

#### Why this is the substantive Layer-1 bridge (two genuine gaps)

The hypothesis lives in the **`localExpand` / `LaurentSeries.orderTop`**
world (the formal `t`-adic expansion at `O`); the conclusion lives in the
**norm-based `ordAtInfty`** world (`Curves/Infinity.lean`, `OrdAtInftyBridge`).
These are two *independently constructed* discrete valuations on `K(E)`. The
two facts originally flagged as residuals are now resolved as follows:

1. **R5a is FALSE as originally stated** (no substitution lemma is needed; the
   gap is a *missing basepoint hypothesis*, not missing chain-rule
   infrastructure). With R5b the statement transports to the `ordAtInfty`
   world, where the genuine Weierstrass relation between `α*x` and `α*y`
   (`pullback_equation`, valid for an abstract `α.pullback` since it is an
   `F`-algebra hom) drives a discrete-valuation argument
   (`ord_pullback_x_neg_of_localParam_pos`). That argument **requires**
   `ordAtInfty (α*x) ≤ 0` ("`α` defined at `O`"), which the `Isogeny` structure
   of this file does not carry — so the unconditional R5a fails (counterexample
   in the R5a note). The conditional, basepoint-hypothesis form is fully proved.

2. **R5b is DONE** (`orderTop_localExpand_eq_ordAtInfty`): the two valuations
   coincide on all of `K(E)`. Both are discrete valuations agreeing on the
   generators (`ordAtInfty (x_gen) = -2 = orderTop formalX`, `y_gen ↦ -3`); the
   proof matches the basis-decomposition `min` formulas
   (`orderTop_localExpand_basis_eq_min`, `ordAtInfty_basis_eq_min`).

So brick 5 reduces to a *true, axiom-clean* basepoint-hypothesis theorem
(`ordAtInfty_pullback_x_gen_neg_of_orderTop_pos_of_base`); only the over-strong
unconditional signatures (R5a and `ordAtInfty_pullback_x_gen_gen_neg_of_orderTop_pos`)
retain a `sorry`, pending a redraft that adds the basepoint hypothesis. See the
ticket in `.mathlib-quality/qf-layer1-brick5-ordAtInfty-bridge-ticket.md`. -/

/-! #### R5a infrastructure: the valuation route (replaces the substitution gap)

The docstring originally flagged R5a as needing the general `localExpand ∘
α.pullback = substitution` development. That framing is unnecessary: with R5b
(`orderTop_localExpand_eq_ordAtInfty`) the whole statement transports into the
norm-based `ordAtInfty` world, where it becomes a *discrete-valuation* argument
that needs **no** substitution lemma. The mechanism is the genuine Weierstrass
relation between `α*x` and `α*y` (`pullback_equation`, which holds for an
abstract `α` because `α.pullback` is an `F`-algebra hom) combined with the
shipped `ordAtInfty` valuation API (`Curves/Infinity.lean`,
`Curves/WithTopArith.lean`).

The lemmas below carry out that argument. The catch — and the reason R5a as
literally stated keeps its `sorry` — is exposed precisely by this route: see
`ord_pullback_x_neg_of_localParam_pos` and the note on R5a. -/

/-- **The genuine R5a content, with the basepoint hypothesis made explicit.**

Set `X = α*x`, `Y = α*y`, `m = ord_O X`, `n = ord_O Y` (both finite, as
`α.pullback` is injective). Since `localParam = -x/y`, `ord_O(α*localParam)
= m − n`, so the hypothesis `h_pos` says `m > n`. The Weierstrass equation for
`(X, Y)` (`pullback_equation_inl`) then forces a pole of `X`:

* `h_base : m ≤ 0` rules out `α(O)` being a *finite* point where `X` is a unit.
  Combined with `m > n` it gives either `m < 0` (done) or `m = 0`.
* If `m = 0` then `n < 0`, and in the Weierstrass identity
  `Y² + a₁XY + a₃Y = X³ + a₂X² + a₄X + a₆` the term `Y²` has order `2n`, which
  is *strictly* smaller than every other term (orders `≥ n > 2n` on the left,
  `≥ 0` on the right). Strict non-archimedean additivity
  (`ordAtInfty_add_eq_of_lt`) makes the left side have order `2n`, while the
  right side has order `≥ 0`; equality forces `2n ≥ 0`, contradicting `n < 0`.

This is exactly the discrete-valuation form of Silverman II.2 / IV.1 (a function
on an elliptic curve has order `−2k`/`−3k` at a pole of `x`). **No substitution
lemma is used.** The hypothesis `h_base` is the valuation form of "`α` is
defined at `O`" (basepoint preservation), which the `Isogeny` structure of this
file does *not* carry — see the note on R5a. -/

/-! ### Generic Weierstrass-point pole brick (the `x`-pole ⟹ `z` reduces direction)

The companion to `ord_pullback_x_neg_of_localParam_pos`: that lemma runs the
discrete-valuation argument "`z` vanishes at `O` ⟹ `x` has a pole at `O`". For
the formal-group subgroup closure we need the **converse, generic** direction:
for *any* point `(X, Y)` on `W_KE W` (the curve over `K(E)`) — not necessarily a
single-isogeny pullback — whose `x`-coordinate `X` has a pole at `O`
(`ord_∞ X < 0`), the local parameter `z = −X/Y` *reduces to `O`*
(`ord_∞ (−X/Y) > 0`).

The mechanism is the standard valuation balance in the Weierstrass equation
`Y² + a₁XY + a₃Y = X³ + a₂X² + a₄X + a₆`: when `X` has a pole of order `m < 0`,
the right-hand side has order exactly `3m` (the `X³` term strictly dominates the
constant-bounded lower terms), so the left-hand side does too; that forces
`ord Y < ord X` (a pole of `Y` strictly deeper than `X`), whence
`ord(−X/Y) = ord X − ord Y > 0`. This is the **`z`-coordinate / IV.1.4 order
conversion** half, generic in `(X, Y)` so it applies to the addition-formula
output `(addPullback_x_pair, addPullback_y_pair)` exactly as to a single pullback.
No formal-group law is used here — only the curve equation and the shipped
`ordAtInfty` valuation API. -/

/-- **Generic: a pole of `X` forces `Y ≠ 0`.** For `(X, Y)` on `W_KE W` satisfying
the Weierstrass equation, if the `x`-coordinate `X` has a pole at `O`
(`ord_∞ X < 0`) then `Y ≠ 0`.

**Why this is axiom-clean (no formal-group law).**  If `Y = 0`, the Weierstrass
equation `Y² + a₁XY + a₃Y = X³ + a₂X² + a₄X + a₆` degenerates to
`X³ + a₂X² + a₄X + a₆ = 0`, i.e. `X` is a root of a *monic cubic with
constant (base-field) coefficients*, hence `X` is algebraic over `K` — but an
element with a pole at `O` (`ord_∞ X = m < 0`) cannot be algebraic over `K`.
Concretely we run the valuation balance directly: `X³` has order `3m`, while
`−(a₂X² + a₄X + a₆)` has order `≥ 2m > 3m` (the lower-degree terms in `X` strictly
dominate because the coefficients are regular at `O`), so the two sides cannot be
equal.  No `addPullback_y_pair`-specific or formal-group input is used — only the
curve equation and the shipped `ordAtInfty` valuation API; so it applies to the
addition-formula output `(addPullback_x_pair, addPullback_y_pair)` exactly as to a
single pullback. -/

/-- **Generic converse: `z` reduces ⟹ `x` has a pole.** For `(X, Y)` on `W_KE W`
satisfying the Weierstrass equation with `X, Y ≠ 0`, if the local parameter
`z = −X/Y` *reduces to `O`* (`ord_∞ (−X/Y) > 0`) **and** `X` is not a unit at `O`
(`ord_∞ X ≤ 0`, the basepoint hypothesis), then `X` has a pole at `O`:
`ord_∞ X < 0`.

This is the generic form of `ord_pullback_x_neg_of_localParam_pos` (which is the
special case `(X, Y) = (α.pullback x_gen, α.pullback y_gen)`); the proof is the
same discrete-valuation argument on the Weierstrass equation. Generic in `(X, Y)`
so it applies to `(addPullback_x_pair, addPullback_y_pair)`. This is the
**back-conversion** step 4 of the formal-group route: once the formal-group
subgroup property gives `ord_∞(z_sum) > 0`, this brick (with the basepoint
hypothesis) returns `ord_∞(addPullback_x_pair) < 0`, the Wall-A goal. -/

/-! **[2026-05-29 B2 — false residuals deleted]** The residuals R5a
(`orderTop_localExpand_pullback_x_gen_neg_of_orderTop_localParam_pos`) and its
composite (`ordAtInfty_pullback_x_gen_gen_neg_of_orderTop_pos`) were DELETED:
both were FALSE as stated for the unconstrained `HasseWeil.Isogeny` (whose
`pullback` is an arbitrary `F`-algebra hom with no basepoint preservation).
Counterexample: over `E : y² = x³ + 1`, the translation-by-`(0,1)` comorphism is
a legal `pullback` with `ord_O(α*localParam) > 0` yet `ord_O(α*x) ≥ 0`,
contradicting the conclusion. The TRUE statements — with the basepoint
hypothesis `ord_O(α*x) ≤ 0` made explicit — are
`ord_pullback_x_neg_of_localParam_pos` and
`ordAtInfty_pullback_x_gen_neg_of_orderTop_pos_of_base` above (both axiom-clean).

/-! ### R5b: the formal valuation `orderTop ∘ localExpand` equals `ordAtInfty`

We prove the full identity `(localExpand f).orderTop = (W_smooth W).ordAtInfty f`
for all `f : KE`, of which R5b is the `< 0` direction. The proof matches the two
valuations on the `F(X)`-subfield (both `= -2 · intDegree`) and on the generator
`y_gen` (both `= -3`), then uses the order-parity / non-cancellation argument on
the basis decomposition `f = α + β · y_gen` (`F(X)`-images have even formal/norm
order, the `β · y_gen` term has odd order). The `ordAtInfty` side of this min
formula is `Curves/Infinity.lean`'s `ordAtInfty_basis_eq_min`; the `localExpand`
side reuses the parity structure already shipped in `LocalExpansion.lean`
(`localExpand_inner_orderTop_eq`, `formalY_orderTop`). -/

/-- `localExpand` of a nonzero `F(X)`-image has formal order `-2 · intDegree`,

*reduces to `O`* (positive order). This is the genuine `x`-pole ⟹ `z`-reduces

where `z_sum` is the addition-formula sum's `z`-coordinate and
`fᵢ = formalIsogenySeries W αᵢ`. The brick below is the *consumer* of that
identity: given the identity (`h_iv14`) and the two summand reductions
(`ord αᵢ(x) < 0`, supplying `0 < order fᵢ` via
`order_formalIsogenySeries_pos_of_ord_x_neg`), it produces the order output
`0 < orderTop (localExpand z_sum)` by composing sub-piece (a)
(`order_formalGroupLaw_subst_pos`) with the `ofPowerSeries` order bridge.

This isolates the **single** irreducible residual to `h_iv14` (the chord-addition
match): everything else — the summand reductions, the subgroup property, the
order transport — is axiom-clean here. -/

/-- **IV.1.4 order output from the formal-group identity (witness-parametric,
axiom-clean).** Given the IV.1.4 identity `h_iv14`
(`localExpand z_sum = ofPowerSeries (F̂(f₁, f₂))`) and the two summand reductions
(`ord αᵢ(x) < 0`), the local-expanded sum `z_sum` has positive `orderTop`:
`0 < orderTop (localExpand z_sum)`.

Composes the shipped sub-pieces: (a) `order_formalGroupLaw_subst_pos` (the formal
group law preserves positive order), the Phase-1 summand bricks
`order_formalIsogenySeries_pos_of_ord_x_neg`, and the order bridge
`orderTop_ofPowerSeries_pos_of_order_pos`. The hypothesis `h_iv14` is the sole
remaining IV.1.4 content (the chord-addition coefficient match). -/
